# Semester Project 1 - Science museum website

The project was created to showcase what I had learned in my first semertser of front-end development studies.

We were tasked with creating a website for an interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum, with a target audience of children (7-15) and families with young children.

Showcase:
Design principles
Communication technology
Development with HTML and CSS
